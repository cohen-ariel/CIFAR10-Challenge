# CNN-CIFAR10-Challenge
Implementation and training of a convolutional NN where the trained model reaches 80% accuracy on the CIFAR10 data set while using 
less than 50,000 parameters (using methods such as drop-out, data augmentation and more).

- This project is "question 1" in an assignment from a university course (Machine Learning 2). Thus, the assignment is attached as 
  instructions (see "Instructions").
- In folder "Code" there appear two modules, one for training and the other for evaluating the model. In addition, a .pkl file is 
  attached with the trained model parameters. 
- To evaluate the model, module "evaluate_model_q1.py" should be run.
- For details regarding the implementation, network architecture and training process, please refer to "Details.pdf".
